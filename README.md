# e-commerce next steps
1. Controllers & Routes: (Partially done)

Set up your endpoints under routes/ (e.g., productRoutes.js, userRoutes.js, etc.).
Or group them by controllers (e.g., productController.js) and import them into a route file.

2. Authentication & JWT:

Implement signup and login routes.
Use bcrypt for hashing the password, and jsonwebtoken (with cookies) for storing the JWT.

3. Admin vs. User:

A simple role check can guard admin routes (e.g., if (req.user.role !== 'ADMIN') return res.status(403)...).

4. Cart/Order Flow:

Expose endpoints like POST /api/orders to create an order from the userâ€™s cart.
Store order items in your OrderItem table.

5. Front-End Integration:

Begin calling these routes from your React front end and React Admin console.

6. Testing:

You can add Jest or Cypress for unit/end-to-end tests. For instance, test user login, product creation, etc.
